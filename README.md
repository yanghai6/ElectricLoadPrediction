# Electric Load Prediction

* The prediction of electric load is a task that can allow generators to decide how much production to ramp up, consumers to estimate electricity prices, and the grid operator to make sure enough transmission capacity is available.

* We are using 4-year electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain from https://www.kaggle.com/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather to build up time series models to predict future electric load using the previously observed values and features like weather.

* We have explored the data, brainstormed what factors could help improve the electric load prediction, proposed several models, and implemented the variants below.
